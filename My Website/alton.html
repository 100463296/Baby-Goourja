Alton Towers Resort
</h1>
<p>In the middle of the British countryside lies a hidden gem: Alton Towers. Branded as the Uk's favouirite theme park, Alton Towers has a wide variety of family rides and thrills. They hold multiple world records such as: The Smiler with the most inversions on any roller coaster in the world and TH13TEEN which is the worlds first free fall drop roller coaster.
</p>
<p>
In 2018, the park opened its most recent roller coaster: Wicker Man

<p>Holding the world record for the first roller coaster in the world to fuse fire and wood, Wicker Man is a great family thrill ride for all ages</p>
<p>Riders can climb on-board the train, racing around a labyrinth of twisted track. The burning embers light the path as the train hurtles towards the six-storey high flaming effigy. Speeding towards the Wicker Man, he spectacularly ignites into flames as the train bursts through his chest three times.</p>
<p>The worldâ€™s most immersive roller coaster experience to date, unifying cutting edge special effects with classic wooden coaster technology for the first time! </p>
